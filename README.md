# Scikit-learn Model Repository

This repository contains various machine learning models implemented using Scikit-learn. The goal is to provide reusable and well-documented models for different tasks, allowing others to contribute and enhance the collection.


## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

# Features
Random Forest Classifier: A robust model for classification tasks.
Support Vector Machine: Efficient for high-dimensional spaces.
K-Means Clustering: Unsupervised learning for clustering tasks.
Model Evaluation Metrics: Functions to evaluate model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).


## Contributions are welcome! You can contribute by adding models, reporting issues, or improving documentation.
